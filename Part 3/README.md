# Maji Ndogo Water Quality and Improvement 

### Overview
This Power BI project explores the state of **water quality, accessibility, and improvement initiatives** in the fictional nation of *Maji Ndogo*.  
It integrates environmental data, infrastructure investment details, and population distribution to visualize progress toward **universal access to clean water**.

##  Pollution Report

The goal here is to assess the state of pollution of the water sources in the different provinces. 

### Key Insights

It is evident that a majority of the water sources in Maji Ndogo are contaminated — either biologically or chemically. **Close to three-quarters** of all sources are unsafe for human consumption.

The bar chart shows that approximately around **7,000** sources are chemically contaminated, around **5,500** are biologically contaminated, and only **5,000** remain clean.

These findings are alarming as they indicate that a significant portion of the population lacks access to safe water, posing risks of waterborne diseases and other health complications.




## Initiatives to Clean

This section aims to implement government-led initiatives to improve the water quality and accessibilty. This involves identifying necessary improvements,  estimating the cost of the improvements and drafting a budget to help the goverment allocate funds to the provinces accordingly. The budget will also help to prioritise certain projects while considering those that would impact the most people.

The improvements to be implemented include:

 1. Drilling wells.
 2. Installing Reverse Osmosis (RO) and Ultraviolet (UV) Filters
 3. Installing Home taps or Shared taps.

The improvements target both purification of water sources and expansion of water sources to improve accessibility.

### National Report

The snapshot show a detailed breakdown of the **budget allocation** by:

- Location type ( Rural and Urban areas )
- Water Source type
- The type of improvement required

The data reveals that **rural areas require significantly more funding** than urban regions across most provinces — except **Amanzi**, where the distribution is relatively balanced.

**Sokoto Province** accounts for the highest projected improvement costs, primarily due to the prevalence of chemically contaminated sources and the high cost of drilling wells as a subsitute to fetching water from rivers. 

 **Reverse Osmosis (RO) filter installations** and **well drilling** will be the most expensive improvements to be made.
 

####  Access to Basic Water

This metric calculates the **ratio of population** to the **basic access to safe water**. Currently the access to basic water is pretty low at **34 %**. This low percentage underlines the urgency of implementing the proposed infrastructure projects to prevent further public health and sanitation challenges.

####  Total Budget Cost
This metric represents the **total projected cost** of implementing all planned improvements.  

Cost assumptions were made for each improvement type and aggregated across all provinces.  The resulting figure provides a baseline for government budget planning and resource allocation.

#### Percentage Improvement
This metric measures the **remaining gap** to achieving **100% basic access** across Maji Ndogo.  It evaluates the share of the population that still experiences poor water access — defined as individuals who queue for more than **30 minutes** at shared taps or rely on **unsafe river sources**.

Tracking this metric over time will help monitor the effectiveness of water improvement initiatives.

 ### Improvements on a Provincial Scale
The analysis can be further examined from a **provincial perspective**, where the **improvement initiatives** and their **associated costs** are visualised and aggregated per province.

This breakdown highlights the **projected expenditure** for each improvement initiative — such as well drilling, filtration systems, and water treatment — and the **total cost per province**. The visualisations below provide a comparative view of these distributions:
