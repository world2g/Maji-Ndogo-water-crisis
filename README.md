# Maji Ndogo Water Crisis

  

Maji Ndogo is a developing nation grappling with the effects of **poor governance, inadequate infrastructure, and limited access to clean water**. The consequences of these issues are evident in the condition of the country's water sources — many of which are **chemically contaminated, poorly maintained, or entirely inaccessible** to large segments of the population.

  

This project leverages **data analytics and visualization** to examine the extent of the crisis and propose data-driven insights that could guide sustainable solutions. The ultimate goal is to **understand, quantify, and visualize** the water challenges faced by Maji Ndogo and highlight **potential areas for intervention**.

  
  
  

## Project Overview

  

Using **Power BI**, this project analyzes datasets related to:

  

- Water source distribution and contamination.

- Population access to clean and basic water.

- Infrastructure improvement initiatives and costs.

- Crime and queue data providing social context to water scarcity.

- Provincial-level variations in access, contamination, and improvement needs.

  

Through interactive dashboards and visual reports, the project aims to communicate the **urgency of the water crisis** and the **scale of investment required** to achieve clean water access for all.

## Key Objectives

  

1.  **Assess the current water access situation** across Maji Ndogo.

2.  **Identify major contamination trends** and regions most in need of intervention.

3.  **Visualize improvement initiatives**, their projected costs, and expected impacts.

4.  **Quantify the gap to 100% clean water access** using DAX-based analysis.

5.  **Support data-informed decision-making** for government and non-government actors.
